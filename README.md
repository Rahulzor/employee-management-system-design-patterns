# Employee Management System (Design Patterns)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based Employee Management System** designed to manage different types of employees such as **Full-Time Employees** and **Contractors**.  
The system demonstrates the practical use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and **Design Patterns** to build a scalable and maintainable application.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Manage employee details efficiently
- Apply design patterns in a real-world scenario
- Understand abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Improve code maintainability and extensibility

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Design Patterns**
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## 🧩 Design Patterns Used

### 1. Factory Pattern
- Used to create different types of employees (Full-Time, Contractor)
- Provides loose coupling between object creation and usage

### 2. Singleton Pattern
- Ensures a single instance of the Employee Management System
- Helps in centralized employee data management

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Add new employees
- Support for multiple employee types
- Centralized employee management
- Console-based user interface
- Extensible design using patterns

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented
- **Abstraction** – Common employee structure
- **Inheritance** – Different employee types
- **Polymorphism** – Dynamic method behavior
- **Encapsulation** – Controlled access to data
